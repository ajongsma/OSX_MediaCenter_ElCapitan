# ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
#
# NAME
#	flushPolicyHistory.sh -- Flush an individual computer's policy history in the JSS.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	sudo flushPolicyHistory.sh
#	sudo flushPolicyHistory.sh <mountPoint> <computerName> <currentUsername>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	This script is designed to be run on any clients that have been previously managed by
#	The Casper Suite.  Running the script will attempt to connect to the JAMF Software Server
#	(JSS) and will flush any historical policy logs for the computer so that the computer appears
#	to have not run any policies.
#
#	This script is most commonly used as an "At Reboot" script that runs as part of a Casper Imaging
#	configuration to ensure that any policies that were previously run on a client will run again
#	after the machine has been re-imaged.
